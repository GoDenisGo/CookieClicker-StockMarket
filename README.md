# Stock Market

A web extension for Google Chrome.
CookieClicker-StockMarket provides additional information for the Stock Market minigame in 
https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/, making it easier to buy and sell stocks with better performance.

This is a simple project to get better at using Web Browser extensions.

### Directories:
- asset: The assets directory stores favicons and content images for the extension.

- content: The content directory stores the files meant to be executed on the website instead of the extension.

- popup: The popup directory contains files to be used by the extension popup window. This includes files for
making the GUI and the scripts running on it.
